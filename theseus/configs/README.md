### config files

The config file collects all information necessary for setting up and running the optimization as well as for saving the
results to a file. The content of the config file is saved into the same directory as the results produced by its run.
Automatically keeping track of all optimization settings allows users to reproduce results more easily.

#### keywords of config files

`description` Description of the experiment that the optimization aims to discover. Is printed at the start of the run.

`foldername` Name of the subfolder. By default, files are saved in _output/configfilename/foldername_. When name is taken, numbers are added.

`samples` Number of optimizations done.

`loss_func` Loss function used. Check _loss_dic_ in _theseus.lossfunctions.py_ for values.

`thresholds` In each optimization step, the loss functions have to be below the thresholds to be considered successful. 

`target_state` Target state for state creation, logic table for quantum gates.

`amplitudes` amplitudes of the kets in the target states. If not given all amplitudes are set to one.

`num_anc` Number of ancillas.

`unicolor` Starting graph is restricted to have only mono-colored edges between target nodes. Less edges mean faster optimization, but it can be a gamble. If your solution is not possible without two-colored edges between target nodes (such as ghz_346) it will not be found.

`removed_connections` list of connections that are removed from complete starting graph before optimization. Can be applied e.g. for entanglement swapping. 

`single_emitters` Defines nodes corresponding to single emitters. Automatically introduces constraints on connections in starting graph (no connections to other single_emitters or in_nodes).

`in_nodes` Defines nodes corresponding to incoming particles, e.g. for measurements and gates. Automatically introduces constraints on connections in starting graph (no connections to other in_nodes or single_emitters).

`out_nodes` Defines nodes corresponding to outgoing particles that are not measured, e.g. for heralded state creation and heralded gates.

`heralding_out` set to true means that `out_nodes` are not detected.

`novac` set to true means that heralded `out_nodes` are guaranteed, no vacuum.

`imaginary` Set false for real number optimization. Set to 'polar' for complex number optimization in polar format.

`optimizer` Optimizer used by scipy.optimize.minimize

`ftol` convergence tolerance for scipy.optimize.minimize

`num_pre` Number of preoptimization done before starting topological optimization on the best result. For target state optimization 1 is good. For entanglement optimization higher values can be better.

`bulk_thr` After preoptimization some edge weights can already be very small. Setting this value to e.g. 0.01 will delete all edges that have a weight smaller than this in absolute value. This can save a lot of time for very big starting graphs, where optimization of many parameters is slow. To skip this step set value to 0.

`topopt` defines if topological optimization is performed. If not given, default value is true. If false, no topological optimization is done (bulk_thr is also overwritten to 0).

`tries_per_edge` During topological optimization, this value sets how often optimization is attempted after deleting one edge. If all tries fail, the next smallest edge is attempted.

`edges_tried` During topological optimization, this value sets how many of the smallest edges are attempted to be deleted. If the optimizer fails to delete all of these edges, topological optimization is terminated.

`safe_hist` If set to true, the history of the loss function values for each topological optimization step is tracked and saved into the result file.

#### for loss_func = 'ent'

`K` 

`dim` Vector defining local dimensions

`min_edge`

`var_factor`

## Naming Conventions for config files
#### Gates
* postselected: `_post`
* single photon sources: `_sp`
* target photon starts in mode 0: `_0`

#### GHZ States
The file `ghz_346` is for a `3` particle `4` dimensional GHZ state produced with a total of `6` photons (in this case this means that 3 ancilla photons are used)

#### Condensed Matter States
File name ending in `_n` identifies that the `n` particle version of that state is produced.
